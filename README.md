Choiisms
========

A simple ASP .NET MVC Project with Entity Framework.

Gives users access to Choi-isms in honor of my friend Choi. Allows users to submit their own Choi-isms as well.

All Choi-isms are viewed in a random order.


Technologies used:
* ASP .NET MVC
* ASP .NET Web API
* Entity Framework
* C#
* SQL Server
* HTML
* ASP .NET Razor Syntax
* Knockout.JS
* Bootstrap
* JQuery


Site released to App Harbor: http://choiisms.apphb.com

I should also note that this is a really good candidate to use a NoSQL database. I have yet to learn any of the available technologies but may tackle that sometime later.
